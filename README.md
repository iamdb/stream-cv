### Requirements:

- OpenCV
- ffmpeg
- libvips
- tesseract

## What is this?

An environment for me to test ideas and learn Rust and become more familiar with these other projects. It has no inherent goal or purpose except to extract a frame out of a stream, run it through a pipeline and output it some place.

To run: `cargo run <path to video file or url to ffmpeg supported stream>`
